# Selenium_Tee_Time_Automation
Automating Tee Time Selection using Selenium Library and Python

# Purpose
The purpose of this code is to gain experience with real world automation problems in python. 
The real world problem I am trying to solve is the weekend morning tee times at my local golf course
get booked within minutes of being released. The idea is this code can be hosted on pythonanywhere (or similar) 
and run at the exact time the tee times are released. 

# Methods 
Usind the inspection method in firefox/chrome browser I am able locate the fields/buttons/text of interest 
and act on the information that is being given by the website. 

# Learnings 
When following tutorials or online courses some of these tasks seem trivial.
When working with a real world example the naming system is inconsistent and often hidden in different tags. 
There is another way to complete with with GET/POST requests using the request python library.
